GAMES

This C++ program implements a collection of four distinct games: Snake and Ladders, Sudoku Solver, Hand Cricket, and Checkers. Each game is designed with a modular structure, allowing for streamlined game management and easy extension to new games in the future.

Games Implemented
Snake and Ladders: A classic board game where players navigate a grid by rolling dice, encountering snakes that send them backward and ladders that propel them forward. The display() function provides a console-based visual representation of the board.

Sudoku Solver: An interactive solver for Sudoku puzzles. This implementation includes backtracking algorithms to fill in missing numbers, adhering to Sudoku rules, and displays the solved puzzle in the console.

Hand Cricket: A turn-based game where players “bat” and “bowl” using randomly generated numbers, simulating a cricket match. Includes mechanics to calculate runs and determine outcomes.

Checkers: A basic checkers game with turn-based moves. Players alternate turns, making moves across a board while capturing opponents' pieces. The display provides visual feedback on the board and current game state.

Program Structure
The GAMES base class provides a framework with virtual functions display() and Instructions(), enabling each game to implement its own display logic and instructions. Each game class derives from GAMES and overrides these methods, encapsulating game-specific data and methods.

Usage
This file is intended to be compiled and run in a C++ environment. It serves as a console-based application for classic games, demonstrating C++ fundamentals like inheritance, polymorphism, and object-oriented design.
